# fourier-transform

This is inspired by a [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY) I saw recently by [3Brown1Blue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), which is basically a channel that uses animation to explain mathematics.

The video is about the [fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), which you can read about on Wikipedia if you're so inclined.

It's quite interesting and has a ton of practical applications, among them:

- signal processing (e.g. video and audio signals)
- spectroscopy (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance imaging)
- quantum mechanics
- etc.

I mostly made this because I thought that some of the graphs produced in the visualisation on Youtube were rather quite beautiful.
